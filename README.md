# MACHINE-LEARNING-PROJECT-REGRESSION-
LAPTOP PRICE PREDICTION (MACHINE LEARNING)

Technology used : Python Programming Language, Machine Learning algorithm (Regression).

Algorithm used : Linear Regression, k-Neighbors Regressor, Support Vector Regression,DecisionTreeRegressor, Random forest regressor, Bagging, Voting, Boosting, Numpy, Pandas.

In this project first I have performed a Exploratory Data Analysis on the data for getting what is a data is actually about.After cleaning the data I have performed Encoding, Scaling and training the data. By applying machine learning algorithm and comparing them I have found best model for the data. Also I have created a function so user can get Estimate price for laptop by providing some inputs.
